# Leetcode Solutions

## Brief Description
This is the collection of my solutions for Leetcode problems. They might not be 
the most optimal ways to solve the problems, but it is honest work :) Feel free 
to use them as your referrences for logic of used algorithms and data structures.

## Dedication
I dedicate this hard work commitment to my Mom who has sacrificed everything for 
my better future. I hope you have always been proud of me!
